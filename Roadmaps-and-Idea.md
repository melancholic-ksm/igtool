## Roadmap & Feature Ideas

- **Cross-Device Profiles** – optionally sync presets via `chrome.storage.sync`, making desktop/laptop setups share the same volume/speed defaults without manual exports.
- **Loop Builder & Bookmarks** – drop A/B markers on long-form clips or Reels carousels so repeated sections can auto-loop or be jumped to with a hotkey.
- **Quick Scrub Gestures** – hold a modifier (Alt/Option) while scrolling to scrub ±5s, with haptic-style on-screen feedback for people using touchpads or Magic Mouse.
- **Clip & Share** – one-click capture of the active segment to a muted GIF or short MP4 so highlights can be shared without external tools.
- **Caption Overlay & Translate** – auto-generate captions through the Web Speech API and offer per-language translation overlays for muted viewing.
- **Watch Queue** – stash interesting Reels/posts into a lightweight queue that auto-advances with the existing next/previous shortcuts.

## Expandation to other applications
- Youtube Shorts (Blending with core features and UiUx)
- TikTok
- Xplateform Videos (replacing core with custom)
